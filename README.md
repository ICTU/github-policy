How ICTU uses GitHub.

ICTU projects, departments, and employees using GitHub should comply with the following guidelines:

- Users:
  - Users have GitHub 2FA authentication turned on.
  - Repository owners report new users and users leaving to [Frank Niessink](@fniessink).

- Repositories:
  - Repositories have a `README.md` file describing the project. 
  - Repositories have a repository owner. The repository owner is a human being who works for ICTU. The `README.md` mentions the repository owner and contact information for the repository owner.
  - Repositories have a `LICENSE` file.
  - Repositories have a `SECURITY.md` file in the root of the repository explaining the security status and point of contact for the repository. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for an example.
  - Repositories have [Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) turned on.
  - Repositories have [Code scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) turned on. 
  - Repository owners ensure that Dependabot and Code scanning alerts are monitored and addressed.
  - Repository owners archive their repositories if they become inactive (meaning no activity for over one year, or no activity for two years if the repository is a fork of another repository).

Point of contact for this repository is [Frank Niessink](@fniessink).
